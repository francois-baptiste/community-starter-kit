# Getting Started Guide

This guide will help you get started using **Team Roundup bot** on your own repositories. For more information on what this bot does, check out the [README](../README.md).

## Installing the bot

The bot works by scanning each of your team's repositories to look for open issues and pull requests assigned to named team members. In order to scan a repository, the app must be installed on that repository. To install the app, use the following instructions:

1. Access the bot installation page [here](#)
1. Under selected repositories, select each of the repositories you would like the bot to scan for open issues and pull requests.

## Creating the config

The bot is designed to open a single "Roundup" issue in your team's primary repository. Inside that repository, you will need to create a config file with some information about your team and repos. Your `_roundup-config.yml` should look something like this:
